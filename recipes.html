                <ul>
                    <li>8 ounces (1/2 pound) cavatappi pasta</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for the pasta water</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon finely ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup (1.3 ounces) finely grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
                    <li>1 cup frozen peas, optional</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup reserved pasta cooking water</li>
                </ul>
            <br>

            <h3 id="sub-heading"> Instructions:</h3>
                <ol id="steps">
                    <li>Cook the pasta:
                        Put a large pot of water on to boil over high heat.
                        Season generously with salt.Once the water is boiling, add the pasta and stir.</li>

                    <li>make the sauce:
                        Add the butter and the garlic and cook just until fragrant but not browned, about 30
                        seconds.
                        Slowly add the cream while stirring and season with salt and pepper.
                        Bring to a simmer, reducing the heat if needed to maintain a simmer.
                        Add the Parmesan a small handful at a time, sprinkling it over top and stirring each time
                        until melted.
                        Add the lemon juice and stir. Turn the heat as low as it’ll go until the pasta is ready,
                        stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Drain the pasta and thaw the peas:
                        Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water. Add the frozen peas to a colander.
                        Drain the pasta over the frozen peas (the hot pasta will help defrost the peas).</li>
                    <li>Toss the pasta and serve:
                        If your skillet is big enough, add the pasta and peas to the sauce.
                        Otherwise, add the pasta and peas back to the pasta pot and pour the sauce over the top.
                        Add 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water and turn the heat to medium.
                        Toss constantly until you have a creamy sauce that coats the noodles, 3 to 5 minutes.
                        Top with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and serve immediately.</li>

            <h2 class="title">Pasta Carbonara</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced</li>
                    <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)</li>
                    <li>3 to 4 whole eggs</li>
                    <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
                    <li>1 pound spaghetti (or bucatini or fettuccine)</li>
                    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="sub-heading">Instructions:</h3>
                <ol id="steps">
                    <li>Heat the pasta water:
                        Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water.)</li>
                    <li>Sauté the pancetta or bacon and garlic:
                        While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil or butter in a large sauté pan over
                        medium heat.
                        Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy.
                        Add the garlic and cook another minute, then turn off the heat and put the pancetta and garlic
                        into a large bowl.
                    <li>Cook the pasta:
                        Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling
                        boil.</li>
                    <li>Toss the pasta with pancetta or bacon:
                        Reserve some of the pasta water.
                        Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta to be hot.
                        It's the heat of the pasta that will heat the eggs sufficiently to create a creamy sauce.
                        Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn't make
                        the eggs curdle when you mix them in. (That's the tricky part.)</li>
                    <li>Add the beaten egg mixture:
                        Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more. Add salt to taste.
                        Add some pasta water back to the pasta to keep it from drying out.</li>
                    <li>Serve at once with the rest of the parmesan and freshly ground black pepper.
                        If you want, sprinkle with a little fresh chopped parsley.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups mascarpone (500g)</li>
                    <li>24 (roughly) Savoiardi biscuits (lady fingers)</li>
                    <li>1 cup strong brewed coffee (230ml)</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons dark chocolate grated</li>
                    <li>4 egg yolks at room temperature</li>
                    <li> 3 egg whites at room temperature</li>
                    <li>6 tablespoons sugar</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons coffee liqueur (optional)</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon cocoa powder</li>

                <ol id="steps">
                    <li>Carefully separate the egg yolks and whites into two separate bowls.
                        Add 3 tablespoons of sugar to the egg yolks and whisk them with an electric whisk until pale and
                        thick.
                        Add the mascarpone and whisk again until smooth and creamy, set aside.</li>
                    <li>Clean your beaters thoroughly. This is very important as egg whites will not whip if any egg
                        yolk is added.</li>
                    <li>Using a clean electric whisk start to whisk the egg whites.
                        When they become frothy, add 3 tablespoons of sugar and whisk until the egg whites are stiff and
                        glossy.
                        You should be able to turn the bowl upside down and they remain stiff (be careful not to
                        overwhip them).</li>
                    <li>Next, add one third of the whisked egg whites to the mascarpone and egg yolk mixture and gently
                        fold it in as you would with a cake batter.
                        Continue with the remaining whites a third at a time until it's completed incorporated.</li>
                    <li>Mix the espresso and 4 tablespoon coffee liqueur in a shallow bowl and dip in the lady
                        fingers (savoiardi biscuits). You want to dip them into the liquid quickly
                        (around 2-3 seconds) whilst turning to soak each side.</li>
                    <li>Lay the ladyfingers in a glass or ceramic dish until you have one even layer.
                        You can brake some biscuits to fit your dish.</li>
                    <li>Next, add half of the mascarpone mixture over the biscuits and spread out
                        in an even layer, top with some grated dark chocolate.</li>
                    <li>Continue with another layer of ladyfingers and mascarpone as directed above.
                        Finally, dust with cocoa powder and chill in the fridge for roughly 6-8 hours.</li>
