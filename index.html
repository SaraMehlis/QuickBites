                    <h3> Creamy Cavatappi Ingredients</h3>
                    <ul>
                       <li>8 ounces (1/2 pound) cavatappi pasta</li>
                       <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
                       <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                       <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
                       <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for the pasta water</li>
                       <li>1/2 teaspoon finely ground black pepper</li>
                       <li>1/2 cup (1.3 ounces) finely grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish</li>
                       <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
                       <li>1 cup frozen peas, optional</li>
                       <li>1/4 cup to 1/2 cup reserved pasta cooking water</li>
        
                       <h3> Instructions</h3>
                    <ol>
                       <li>Cook the pasta:
                        Put a large pot of water on to boil over high heat.
                         Season generously with salt.Once the water is boiling, add the pasta and stir. 
                        Cook untiljust short of al dente, according to the package directions.
                        <!--TIP
                        Make the sauce while the pasta cooks. 
                        Don’t forget to save some pasta water before draining the cavatappi!-->
                       <li>Meanwhile, make the sauce:
                        While the pasta cooks, add the butter to a large skillet over medium heat. 
                        Once melted, add the garlic and cook just until fragrant but not browned, about 30 seconds. 
                        Slowly add the cream while stirring and season with salt and pepper. 
                        Bring to a simmer, reducing the heat if needed to maintain a simmer. 
                        Cook, while stirring, until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.
                        Add the Parmesan a small handful at a time, sprinkling it over top and stirring each time until melted. 
                        Add the lemon juice and stir. Turn the heat as low as it’ll go until the pasta is ready, stirring occasionally.</li>
                        <li>Drain the pasta and thaw the peas:
                        Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water. Add the frozen peas to a colander.
                        Drain the pasta over the frozen peas (the hot pasta will help defrost the peas).</li>
                        <li>Toss the pasta and serve:
                        If your skillet is big enough, add the pasta and peas to the sauce. 
                        Otherwise, add the pasta and peas back to the pasta pot and pour the sauce over the top.
                        Add 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water and turn the heat to medium. 
                        Toss constantly until you have a creamy sauce that coats the noodles, 3 to 5 minutes. 
                        If the sauce seems too thick, add more pasta water a small splash at a time, tossing in between. 
                        <!--TIP
                        You’ll want the sauce slightly looser than you think since it will thicken quickly as it cools.-->
                        <li>Taste, adding salt and/or pepper if needed. 
                            Top with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and serve immediately.</li>
                        <li>Creamy cavatappi is best eaten hot and freshly made, 
                            but you can refrigerate it in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in the microwave or 
                            on the stovetop, adding a little water or cream to loosen the sauce.</li>
        
                        </ol>

                    <h3>Pasta Carbonara Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <!--Tips for Carbonara Success
        The beauty of this dish is in its simplicity, yet it can take a little practice to get it just right.
        Prepare ahead: Since this dish comes together so quickly, and timing is crucial,
        be sure to have all of your ingredients and equipment ready to go from the start.
        Temper the eggs: Working quickly after draining the pasta is paramount to having success. 
        To streamline things, have the beaten eggs at the ready in a bowl, and quickly whisk in a
        few tablespoons of reserved hot pasta cooking water to temper them. This makes them less likely to curdle once 
        you toss them with the cooked pasta. Then toss the pasta with the tempered eggs in the still-warm cooking pot,
        which will help the mixture stay warm enough to melt the cheese. 
        Use high-quality cheese: Set down the processed cheese shaker! 
        For this dish, it's key to use real, high-quality Parmesan cheese. Trust us, this recipe is worth it.
        If you're going to indulge, why not do it right?-->
        
                      <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter</li>
                      <li>1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced</li>
                      <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)</li>
                      <li>3 to 4 whole eggs</li>
                      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
                      <li>1 pound spaghetti (or bucatini or fettuccine)</li>
                      <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3> Instructions</h3>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Heat the pasta water:</li> 
                      Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water.)
                      <li>Sauté the pancetta or bacon and garlic:
                      While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil or butter in a large sauté pan over medium heat. 
                      Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy.
                      Add the garlic (if using) and cook another minute, then turn off the heat and put 
                      the pancetta and garlic into a large bowl.
                      <li>Cook the pasta:
                      Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.</li>
                      <li>Toss the pasta with pancetta or bacon:
                      When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, not mushy),
                      use tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water.
                      Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta to be hot. 
                      It's the heat of the pasta that will heat the eggs sufficiently to create a creamy sauce.
                      Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn't make
                      the eggs curdle when you mix them in. (That's the tricky part.)</li>
                      <li>Add the beaten egg mixture:
                      Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more. Add salt to taste. 
                      Add some pasta water back to the pasta to keep it from drying out.</li>
                      Serve at once with the rest of the parmesan and freshly ground black pepper. 
                      If you want, sprinkle with a little fresh chopped parsley.

                <h3> Tiramisu – Authentic Recipe Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                2 cups mascarpone (500g)
                <li>24 (roughly) Savoiardi biscuits (lady fingers)</li>
                <li>1 cup strong brewed coffee (230ml)</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons dark chocolate grated</li>
                <li>4 egg yolks at room temperature</li>
                <li> 3 egg whites at room temperature</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons sugar</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons coffee liqueur (optional)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cocoa powder</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Carefully separate the egg yolks and whites into two separate bowls. 
                Add 3 tablespoons of sugar to the egg yolks and whisk them with an electric whisk until pale and thick.
                Add the mascarpone and whisk again until smooth and creamy, set aside.</li>
                <li>Clean your beaters thoroughly. This is very important as egg whites will not whip if any egg yolk is added.</li>
                <li>Using a clean electric whisk start to whisk the egg whites. 
                 When they become frothy, add 3 tablespoons of sugar and whisk until the egg whites are stiff and glossy. 
                 You should be able to turn the bowl upside down and they remain stiff (be careful not to overwhip them).</li>
                <li>Next, add one third of the whisked egg whites to the mascarpone and egg yolk mixture and gently fold it in as you would with a cake batter. 
                Continue with the remaining whites a third at a time until it's completed incorporated.</li>
                <li>Mix the espresso and 4 tablespoon coffee liqueur in a shallow bowl and dip in the lady 
                fingers (savoiardi biscuits). You want to dip them into the liquid quickly 
                (around 2-3 seconds) whilst turning to soak each side.</li>
                <li>Lay the ladyfingers in a glass or ceramic dish until you have one even layer. 
                You can brake some biscuits to fit your dish.</li>
                <li>Next, add half of the mascarpone mixture over the biscuits and spread out
                in an even layer, top with some grated dark chocolate.</li>
                <li>Continue with another layer of ladyfingers and mascarpone as directed above. 
                    Finally, dust with cocoa powder and chill in the fridge for roughly 6-8 hours.</li>
                
                <!--Notes
                (the egg yolks are whisked first and whites second) all other methods and ingredients remain the same.
                Whisking the eggs - make sure you don't get any egg yolk in the egg whites before beating them. If you do they will collapse and won't become stiff peaks and glossy like you need them.
                Liqueur - other than coffee liqueur you could use amaretto, dark rum, marsala, brandy, or Frangelico.
                Savoiardi - it's really important to use Italian Savoiardi cookies, Pavensini are another good option or ladyfingers but make sure they are crisp in texture and not soft.
                Topping - The cocoa powder will darken as it soaks into the mascarpone mixture in the fridge, you can add an extra sprinkling just before serving if you prefer.
                Let it rest - Leave the Tiramisu in the fridge for at least 6 hours, overnight is even better. This gives the Savoiardi or ladyfingers a chance to soften and soak up the flavours and gives the whole dessert a chance to develop and become extra delicious.
                Size of dish used - I used an 8x10 inch dish to make this Tiramisu you may need more or less ladyfingers according to your dish size.
                Storage - will keep well in the fridge for 2-3 days.-->
